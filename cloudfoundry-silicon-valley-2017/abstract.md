Josh has been working on the release integration team for CloudFoundry as a representative of Dell/EMC since July 20##.  In that time, he has used bosh to deploy, test, debug, and do most things that bosh can do. Before working in DevOps on CloudFoundry, Josh worked as a Ruby-on-Rails developer for MathWorks, as an English teacher in Japan, and as a Mac Systems Administrator for MIT's Language Learning and Resource Center. Josh has started and served as President for two Toastmasters clubs: one in Japan and one in MathWorks, speaking many times at those organizations on a variety of topics.

## Provide a session abstract covering what you would like to present. This abstract is what will be used on the event schedule if your submission is selected.

Using bosh is hard.  Using bosh to migrate existing deployments is harder.  Steve and Josh had the opportunity to work at length with migrating a separate CF Release and Diego deployment to a single CF Deployment manifest using bosh.  The process of migrating to CF Deployment sounded much easier than it actually was, and they have learned some tips and tricks on the way that may be useful to bosh operators and the Cloud Foundry community at large.  Through this session you will learn how to migrate bosh deployments.

## Describe who the audience is and what you expect them to gain from your presentation.

We expect the audience to be primarily bosh users of some kind.  Bosh operators will find this content particularly useful as they may trying to do the same kinds of things that we did in this project.

## Tell us how the content of your presentation will help Cloud Foundry community.

The Cloud Foundry community will learn how to avoid some pitfalls that you run into trying to migrate bosh deployments.

## Select the experience level (Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced, Any) of those who should attend this session.
